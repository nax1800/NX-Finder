# NX-Finder

This is a small project made for offset finding (WIP), gives offsets such as: GObjects, AppendString, CreateNetDriver, SetWorld, InitListen, etc.... It lets you look into any class/object, check the Properties/Functions and get the Offsets of properties (which could be good for things such as cheats).
